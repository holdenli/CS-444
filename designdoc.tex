\section*{Introduction}

This document outlines the design and implementation of semantic and
context-sensitive analysis for the Joosc compiler. We first describe the main
design changes with respect to the previous design, such as testing and
executable changes. Following that, we outline the additional stages of
compilation that are implemented for assignments 2 through 4, in addition to
providing implementation details for each stage. The additional stages are
described (and grouped) in order of the original assignment submissions.
